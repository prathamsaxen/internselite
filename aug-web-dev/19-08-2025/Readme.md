## 1. CSS Flexbox Layout ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The provided CSS uses **Flexbox** to create a responsive, centered grid.

* `display: flex;` transforms the `.wrapper` into a flex container, enabling Flexbox properties for its children.
* `justify-content: center;` horizontally centers the child elements (`.container` divs) within the `.wrapper`.
* `align-items: center;` vertically centers the children.
* `gap: 10px;` adds 10 pixels of space between the child items, both horizontally and vertically.
* `flex-wrap: wrap;` is a crucial property that allows the children to wrap onto a new line if they don't all fit on a single line. This is what makes the layout responsive. Without it, all the `.container` divs would try to squeeze onto one line, causing them to shrink or overflow.

## 2. CSS Animations üé¨

The code includes two keyframe animations, though they are commented out. **Keyframes** define the stages of an animation.

* `@keyframes rotate-anim`: This animation defines a transition from `transform: rotate(720deg)` and `scale: 0.1` (spinning twice and appearing very small) to `transform: rotate(0deg)` and `scale: 1` (stopping the spin and returning to normal size). This creates a "fly-in" or "drop-in" effect.
* `@keyframes visibility-anim`: This animation transitions an element's opacity from `0.1` (almost transparent) to `1` (fully visible). This creates a simple fade-in effect.
* **Animation Timing Functions**: Your code asks about timing functions. A timing function, like `ease-in-out`, defines the speed curve of an animation. It determines how an animation progresses over time.
    * `ease`: Starts slow, accelerates, then slows down at the end. (Default)
    * `linear`: Same speed from start to finish.
    * `ease-in`: Starts slow and accelerates.
    * `ease-out`: Starts fast and decelerates.
    * `ease-in-out`: Starts slow, accelerates, then slows down.

## 3. CSS Media Queries for Responsive Design üì±

**Media queries** are a cornerstone of responsive web design. They allow you to apply different styles based on the device's characteristics, most commonly the viewport's width. Your code uses media queries to change the background color of the `.wrapper` based on the screen size. 

* `@media screen and (max-width: 480px)`: This rule applies its styles when the screen width is **480 pixels or less**. This would typically target mobile phones. Here, the wrapper's background turns black.
* `@media screen and (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 768px)`: This rule targets devices with screen widths between **481px and 768px**, such as tablets or larger mobile devices. The background color becomes red.
* `@media screen and (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1080px)`: This applies styles to screens between **769px and 1080px**, which typically includes medium-sized laptops and large tablets. The background color turns blue.
