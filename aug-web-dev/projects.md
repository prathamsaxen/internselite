### 1. Responsive Weather Web App

This project involves creating a responsive web application that displays weather information for a given city. It should be built with a strong focus on **user experience** and the integration of external APIs.

#### **Core Functionality**

* **City-based Weather Display:** Users should be able to enter the name of any city in a search bar, and the application will fetch and display the current weather conditions for that location. The displayed information should include key details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather (e.g., "sunny," "cloudy," "rainy").
* **API Integration:** The application must use a third-party API to retrieve the weather data. Specifically, it should **integrate with a weather API from RapidAPI**.
* **Location-based Weather Detection:** The app should have an additional feature that **automatically detects the user's current location** (using the browser's geolocation API) and displays the weather for that location upon loading. This provides a more convenient, personalized experience.
* **Responsive Design:** The application's layout and design must be **fully responsive**, meaning it adapts and looks great on various screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop computers.
* **Dynamic Theming:** The app's visual theme should **change dynamically based on the current weather conditions**. For example, if the weather is sunny, the theme should be warm and yellow-toned ‚òÄÔ∏è; if it's rainy, the theme should be cool and blue-toned üåßÔ∏è; and if it's snowy, a pale or white-toned theme ‚ùÑÔ∏è.

### 2. Todo App

This project focuses on building a full-featured To-Do List application that includes user authentication and robust data management.

#### **Core Functionality**

* **User Authentication:** The application must include a secure **authentication system**. Users should be able to create an account (sign up), log in, and log out. This ensures that each user's to-do list is private and accessible only to them.
* **CRUD Operations:** The app should support **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** operations for to-do items.
    * **Create:** Users can add new tasks to their list.
    * **Read:** The app displays the user's list of tasks.
    * **Update:** A key requirement is the ability to **edit or update** an existing task. For example, a user should be able to change the text of a task or mark it as complete.
    * **Delete:** Users can remove tasks from their list.
* **Improved User Experience (UX):** The design should be **intuitive and easy to use**. This includes a clean interface, clear visual feedback for user actions (e.g., a checkmark when a task is completed), and an overall polished look and feel.

#### **Deployment**

Both projects should be deployed to a **live web server** (e.g., using services like Netlify, Vercel, or Heroku). The final output should be a publicly accessible URL for each application, demonstrating that the projects are not just functional locally but are ready for real-world use. This step is crucial for showcasing a complete development lifecycle.
